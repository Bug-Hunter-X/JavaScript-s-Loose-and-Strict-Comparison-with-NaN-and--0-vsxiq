# JavaScript's Loose and Strict Comparison with NaN and -0

This repository demonstrates an uncommon quirk in JavaScript's comparison operators: the handling of NaN (Not a Number) and -0 (negative zero). 

## The Bug

JavaScript's loose comparison (`==`) and strict comparison (`===`) exhibit unexpected behavior when comparing `NaN` and `-0`:

* `NaN` is never equal to itself, even when using strict equality (`===`).
* `0` and `-0` are considered equal using both loose (`==`) and strict (`===`) equality.

The `bug.js` file contains a simple function that highlights this issue.  The output shows that `NaN === NaN` evaluates to `false`, while `0 === -0` evaluates to `true`.  This can lead to unexpected results and logic errors in your code.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution for handling these cases.  The best approach depends on the specific scenario. For `NaN`, you should use the `isNaN()` function to explicitly check for `NaN` values. For `-0`, you might need to implement specific logic depending on your use case.  For example, you might need to handle these scenarios separately.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js, a web browser's console).
3. Run the file and observe the output.
4. Compare this with the output from `bugSolution.js` to understand the correct way to perform the comparison.

This example demonstrates how crucial it is to be aware of the subtle intricacies of JavaScript's type system and comparison operators, especially when dealing with special numeric values like `NaN` and `-0`.
